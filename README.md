## 🔬 Feature Project 1: Breast Cancer Detection Pipeline (PyTorch)

This module focuses on evaluating and scaling machine learning models for automated breast cancer detection, transitioning from a basic baseline to state-of-the-art medical imaging architectures.

### Phase 1: The Baseline (Current)
* **Architecture:** Single Multi-Layer Neural Network.
* **Objective:** Establish a core end-to-end pipeline (data loading, preprocessing, training loop, and evaluation).

### Phase 2: Advanced Computer Vision Upgrades (In Progress)
To reduce false negatives and capture subtle tissue patterns, the pipeline is being upgraded with the following architectures:
* **Transfer Learning via DenseNet-121 / ResNet-50:** Leveraging ImageNet pre-trained weights to preserve detailed feature maps.
* **Vision Transformers (ViTs):** Capturing global context across high-resolution mammogram and ultrasound scans.
* **U-Net Segmentation:** Moving beyond binary classification to actively segment and highlight regions of interest (tumors).

### Phase 3: Tabular & Ensemble Integration
* **Hybrid Models:** Extracting deep spatial features using CNNs and passing them into optimized **XGBoost/LightGBM** classifiers.
* **Model Ensembling:** Combining predictions from multiple architectures to maximize the pipeline's overall $F_1$-score and clinical reliability.

## 🏦 Feature Project 2: Bank Customer Churn Prediction (Keras & TensorFlow)

This module implements a fully connected Artificial Neural Network (ANN) pipeline to solve a binary classification problem: predicting whether a bank customer is likely to leave (**exit**) or stay.

### Pipeline Breakdown
*   **Data Preprocessing:** Performs categorical encoding on geographical and gender data (`pd.get_dummies`), handles data splitting (80/20 train-test ratio), and applies feature scaling (`StandardScaler`) to optimize gradient descent.
*   **Architecture:** A Sequential neural network mapping **11 input features** into **two hidden layers (6 neurons each)** using `He Uniform` initialization and `ReLU` activation, leading to a single-neuron `Sigmoid` output layer.
*   **Training & Metrics:** Compiled with the `Adamax` optimizer and trained over **100 epochs** (batch size 10) with a 33% live validation split. The script automatically plots accuracy and loss convergence curves across training epochs.
